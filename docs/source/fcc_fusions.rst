Fragment Combination Classification - Fusions
=============================================

The fusion category describes the presence of fused atoms, i.e. common atoms
shared by both fragments. The number of fused atoms determines the type of fusion:

- 1 fused atom in either fragments: fusion spiro (**fs**)
- 2 fused atoms in both fragments: fusion edge (**fe**)
- 3 ≤ fused atoms ≤ 5 in either fragments: fusion bridged (**fb**)
- > 5 fused atoms in either fragments: fusion linker (**fl**)
