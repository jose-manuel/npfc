Category,Name,Description
Core,fc_classify,Classify fragment combinations by pairwise comparison of fragment hits for each molecule.
Core,fcg_annotate_pnp,Annotate FCGs with PNP information.
Core,fcg_generate,Generate fragment combination graphs using all fragment combinations found for each molecules.
Core,frags_annotate_fcp,Annotate the fragments with Fragment Combination Points (FCP).
Core,frags_search,Search for fragments in molecules (substructure search).
Core,mols_dedupl,Filter out duplicate molecules and (if provided) update a reference file for processing in parallel.
Core,mols_depict,Generate 2D-coordinates for molecules.
Core,mols_draw,Draw molecules into individual files. Useful for exporting fragment images for FCG representation.
Core,mols_extract_murcko,Extract the Murcko scaffold from molecules.
Core,mols_load,Load molecules into RDKit format.
Core,mols_standardize,Apply a serie of standardization operations on molecules.
Core,mols_subset,Filter out molecules from a molecular file using another molecular file as a reference.
Miscelleneous,fhits_filter,Filter out one or several fragment hits from fragment- search and combination results using their fragment ID (i.e. remove benzene from completed runs with benzene). Useful for running first the NPFC workflow with a given fragment and then compare the results without the fragment without having to run the Fragment Search and Fragment Combination steps again.
Report,report/report_fcg_chunk,Preprocess the report of the FCG information for a given chunk  (optimization for cluster)
Report,report/report_fcg_concat,Concatenate all chunks of FCG informations produced by report_fcg_chunk and generate the report.
Report,report/report_fcg2,Report the number of fragment hits and fragment combinations and fragment combination graphs.
Report,report/report_fcp,Report the number of symmetry centers found in fragments. 
Report,report/report_mols_count,Report the number of molecules found for a given chunk in all steps of a workflow.
Report,report/report_pnp,Report the number of PNP and NP-like molecules.
Report,report/report_prep,Report the number of passed filtered and error molecules during preparation.
Report,report/report_subset,Report the number of molecules filtered out of the input dataset during subsetting.
Report,report/report_time,Report  the computation duration of a given chunk in all steps of a workflow.
Workflow management,chunk_check,Check if there are missing chunks in the output directory.
Workflow management,chunk_sdf,Split a SDF into chunks without parsing molecules.
Workflow management,concat_sdf,Concatenate SDF chunks into a single SDF without parsing molecules.
Workflow management,concat_synonyms,Concatenate all synonym files (references for identifying duplicate molecules) into a single file.
Workflow management,mols_concat,Concatenate two molecular files.
Workflow management,mols_count,Count the number of molecules in a molecular file.
Workflow management,report_protocol,DEPRECATED. Reports are now generated automatically during workflow executions.
Workflow management,run_protocol_fc,Run a snakemake workflow (either fragments or natural or synthetic).
